# Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
Developed a robust machine learning model achieving 95% accuracy in distinguishing malignant and benign tumors, aiding in precise medical diagnostics.

Overview:
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to classify breast tumors as malignant or benign based on various features. It achieves 95% accuracy in its predictions, contributing to accurate medical diagnostics.

Key Features:
Dataset: Utilized the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Models: Implemented Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and SVM classifiers for comparison.
Evaluation: Evaluated models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
Technologies Used:
Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebooks.

Usage:
Run breast_cancer_detection.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook to explore data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
Customize models and parameters for further experimentation.
